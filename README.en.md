# WechatMagician

## Supported Features
* Prevent friends from recalling messages.
* Prevent friends from deleting moments or comments.

Currently support the latest WeChat 6.5.13. This module can match the method signature dynamically to defeat the the obfucator used by WeChat; a new WeChat version can hardly break it.

__The leading chinese word "[已撤回]" means "have been recalled".__

__The sentences in third message (that picture) means "the image has been recalled, click to check it".__

## Credits
* Thanks @rovo89 for the awesome Xposed framework.
* Thanks @rarnu for the prototype module wechat_no_revoke.

Well, although I deleted almost all the codes written by @rarnu, I still want to give the credit for the nice structure. :>
